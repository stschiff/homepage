  abstract  = "Being able to digest milk sugar beyond the age of weaning is a
               rather new trait in humans. The calculated age of the
               responsible mutations largely coincides with the introduction of
               dairy farming. Recent European populations exhibit a gradient of
               high levels of lactose tolerance in the north and lower numbers
               in the south. Lactase persistence is believed to have co-evolved
               with farming or livestock keeping as a selective advantage.
               Palaeogenetic data of prehistoric individuals, however, have so
               far not provided any clear evidence that the spread of the
               lactase persistence mutation predates the Roman period, while
               persistence increases throughout the Middle Ages. In contrast,
               evidence of dairy processing reaches back to the introduction of
               farming in the Neolithic. In this paper, we investigate lactase
               persistence in the La Tène period of the European Iron Age. 39
               individuals from Austria, France, Hungary and Switzerland have
               been successfully genotyped for the two single nucleotide
               polymorphisms (SNPs) 13910C/T and 22018G/A, which are associated
               with lactose tolerance. None of those individuals carries the
               homozygous variant of either of the two SNPs, while four
               individuals are heterozygous at 22018G/A. This implies that
               during the Iron Age processed dairy products like cheese and
               yoghurt still represented the common supply of milk-derived
               nutrients while fresh milk played only a minor role in the
               regions studied here. The population-wide spread of the lactose
               tolerance trait in Europe therefore clearly post-dates the Iron
               Age.",

              the sources of the majority of previously published ancient
              African genomes. However, the high temperature environments that
              characterise much of Africa often lead to poor preservation of
              skeletal remains. Here, we successfully reconstruct and analyse
              genome-wide data from the naturally mummified hair of a
              4000-year-old individual from Sudan in northeastern Africa, after
              failed attempts at DNA extraction from teeth, petrous, and
              cranium of this and other individuals from the Kadruka
              cemeteries. We find that hair DNA extracted with an established
              single-stranded library protocol is unusually enriched in
              ultra-short DNA molecules and exhibits substantial interior
              molecular damage. The aDNA was nonetheless amenable to genetic

              indistinguishable from that of early Neolithic eastern African

              with established models for the southward dispersal of Middle
              Nile Valley pastoral populations to the Rift Valley of eastern
              Africa, and provide a possible genetic source population for this

              allows for large-scale meta-analysis applications.
              Trans-generational past human mobility is one of the key aspects
              that ancient genomics can contribute to since changes in genetic
              ancestry-unlike cultural changes seen in the archaeological
              record-necessarily reflect movements of people. Here, we present
              an algorithm for spatiotemporal mapping of genetic profiles,
              which allow for direct estimates of past human mobility from
              large ancient genomic datasets. The key idea of the method is to
              derive a spatial probability surface of genetic similarity for
              each individual in its respective past. This is achieved by first
              creating an interpolated ancestry field through space and time
              based on multivariate statistics and Gaussian process regression
              and then using this field to map the ancient individuals into
              space according to their genetic profile. We apply this algorithm
              to a dataset of 3138 aDNA samples with genome-wide data from
              Western Eurasia in the last 10,000 y. Finally, we condense this
              sample-wise record with a simple summary statistic into a
              diachronic measure of mobility for subregions in Western,
              Central, and Southern Europe. For regions and periods with
              sufficient data coverage, our similarity surfaces and mobility
              estimates show general concordance with previous results and
              provide a meta-perspective of genetic changes and human mobility.",

              Demographic models of current interest typically consist of a set
              of discrete populations, their sizes and growth rates, and
              continuous and pulse migrations between those populations over a
              number of epochs, which can require dozens of parameters to fully
              describe. There is currently no standard format to define such
              models, significantly hampering progress in the field. In
              particular, the important task of translating the model
              descriptions in published work into input suitable for population
              genetic simulators is labor intensive and error prone. We propose
              the Demes data model and file format, built on widely used
              technologies, to alleviate these issues. Demes provide a
              well-defined and unambiguous model of populations and their

              a text file format that is designed for simplicity and clarity.

  abstract  = "The history of the British Isles and Ireland is characterized by
               multiple periods of major cultural change, including the
               influential transformation after the end of Roman rule, which
               precipitated shifts in language, settlement patterns and
               material culture1. The extent to which migration from
               continental Europe mediated these transitions is a matter of
               long-standing debate2–4. Here we study genome-wide ancient DNA
               from 460 medieval northwestern Europeans—including 278
               individuals from England—alongside archaeological data, to infer
               contemporary population dynamics. We identify a substantial
               increase of continental northern European ancestry in early
               medieval England, which is closely related to the early medieval
               and present-day inhabitants of Germany and Denmark, implying
               large-scale substantial migration across the North Sea into
               Britain during the Early Middle Ages. As a result, the
               individuals who we analysed from eastern England derived up to
               76\% of their ancestry from the continental North Sea zone,
               albeit with substantial regional variation and heterogeneity
               within sites. We show that women with immigrant ancestry were
               more often furnished with grave goods than women with local
               ancestry, whereas men with weapons were as likely not to be of
               immigrant ancestry. A comparison with present-day Britain
               indicates that subsequent demographic events reduced the
               fraction of continental northern European ancestry while
               introducing further ancestry components into the English gene
               pool, including substantial southwestern European ancestry most
               closely related to that seen in Iron Age France5,6.
               Archaeogenetic study of ancient DNA from medieval northwestern
               Europeans reveals substantial increase of continental northern
               European ancestry in Britain, suggesting mass migration across
               the North Sea during the Early Middle Ages.",
