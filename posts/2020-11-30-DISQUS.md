title: DISQUS available on my webpage

I have finally gotten around to install DISQUS on my webpage’s blog posts. When you view my blog, you will now find below every post a section where you can comment and discuss with other users via DISQUS. DISQUS is an online tool that provides discussion forum-like capabilities to any webpage. It’s an awesome service that spares webpage authors the annoyance of having to provide a database and fully fledged backend usually required to provide user-management and forum-functionality.

I hope it provides useful for some readers who want to engage with the content.

**Update (June 2023): DISQUS has been disabled as I am transitioning to a new frontend framework. I will reactivate it soon again**
