I am excited to announce our upcoming summer school “Bridging Archaeogenetics and Medieval Studies: Using aDNA as a source for migration, demographics, kinship and pathology” in **Berlin and Leipzig in September 23-27, 2024**.

I’m co-organising the summer school with Historian [Jörg Feuchter](https://www.bbaw.de/die-akademie/mitarbeiterinnen-mitarbeiter/feuchter-joerg) from the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences, and several colleagues from the MPI-EVA are scheduled as speakers as well.

We are seeking master students and senior PhD students from both science and humanities backgrounds to apply **until April 30th**. 

More information can be found on our [website](https://www.bbaw.de/die-akademie/mitarbeiterinnen-mitarbeiter/feuchter-joerg/summer-school)
