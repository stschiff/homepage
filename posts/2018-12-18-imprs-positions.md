The International Max Planck Research School for the Science of human history is seeking up to 16 candidates for pursuing a PhD in 14 projects.

The MPI-SHH pursues an integrative approach to the study of human history. Both “hard” facts, such as bones, teeth, plants and stone tools, as well as “soft” facts such as languages, historical sources, or religion can serve as raw material to study the human past. The International Max Planck Research School for the Science of Human History (IMPRS-SHH) is seeking a total of 16 candidates for 14 PhD projects in this young and interdisciplinary research field.

The IMPRS-SHH is a cooperation of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and Friedrich Schiller University (FSU), both situated in Jena, a traditional as well as a modern university town in the heart of Germany. Being integrated into state-of-the art ongoing research at the MPI-SHH and FSU, the IMPRS-SHH provides doctoral researchers with a stimulating environment and optimal conditions for their PhD projects. We offer a clearly structured doctoral program with three pillars: a mentoring program for individual supervision by outstanding scientists, a scientific program of high academic standard, and a transferable skills program.

Participating disciplines include Genetics, Archaeology, Linguistics, Bioinformatics, Comparative Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Demographic History, Earth Sciences, Evolutionary Ecology, Geoscience, History, Physical Anthropology, Plant Biology.
