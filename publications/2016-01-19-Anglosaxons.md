This was the first paper to publish ancient genomes from Great Britain. We developed a new method, rarecoal, to analyse rare genetic variation to infer genetic ancestry with higher resolution than before. We could show that during the Anglo-Saxon migration period in England, continental European ancestry increased, as seen through an increased allele sharing with present-day Dutch and Danish people.
