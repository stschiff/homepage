This is an interdisciplinary paper which combines archaeology and genetics to a investigate social structure and ancestry in a microregion (the Southern German Lech-valley) during the Early Bronze Age. We analysed over 100 individuals genetically and based on isotopes and could reconstruct several large family pedigrees, up to five generations. We give insights into patterns of patrilocality and rules of inheritance of status.
