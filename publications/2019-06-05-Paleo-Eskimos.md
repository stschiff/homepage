This is a big paper in which we summarise more than three years of work on the peopling history of North America. We analysed 48 ancient genomes, including three prehistoric Athabaskan individuals from Alaska, and find that those individuals as well as extant Athabaskans inherit a large proportion of their ancestry from so-called Paleo-Eskimos. We modelled this ancestry and its relationship to other North-American and Northeast-Asian human groups, and show how the Paleo-Eskimo migration shaped human ancestry throughout the American Arctic until today. I wrote a blog post about this work [here](https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/users/253326-stephan-schiffels/posts/49657-paleo-eskimo-ancestry-in-north-america-or-how-to-grow-a-paper-from-6-to-35-authors)
