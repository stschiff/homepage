<p>Human history is deeply imprinted in our genomes, through patterns of common
ancestry. These patterns can be studied by looking at mutations that are shared
between people living in different times in different places. In this post I
will summarize our <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160119/ncomms10408/full/ncomms10408.html">recent genetic
study</a>
on Anglo-Saxon immigration history in Britain, and in doing so,will describe
some new methodology that we have developed for this project, which is based on
rare mutations.</p>
<hr />
<p>A large majority of the inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland today speak
English, a language related to Dutch and German. Going back 2,000 years, their
native tongue was a Celtic language, related to Welsh, Gaelic and Irish, which
are spoken by relatively few people today compared to English.</p>
<p>This change of language is a striking example for the large cultural impact of
the Anglo-Saxon migration period, which started around 400AD with peoples from
the continental coast (mainly Jutes, Angles, Saxons and Frisians) migrating into
the South and East of England. From archaeology, we know that during this period
burial practices, jewellery industry, religious rituals and many aspects of
communal life, changed.</p>
<p>Who were the Anglo-Saxons? How did they interact with the local population?
Today, we can find answers to these questions from Genetics, in particular with
the help of ancient DNA.</p>
<hr />
<p>We collected teeth from 8 female and 2 male individuals who lived in villages
near Cambridge at various times between 2,000 and 1,200 years ago. From the
teeth we drilled bone powder, extracted hundreds of millions of short fragments
of DNA and by sequencing these fragments we reconstructed the first complete
ancient genomes from Great Britain to date (<a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160119/ncomms10326/full/ncomms10326.html">another
study</a>
with ancient British genomes came out at the same time).</p>
<p>From precise carbon-dating, we know that the ten ancient genomes can be divided
into two groups: Three individuals are from the late Iron Age, around
100BC-50AD, and 7 samples are from the Early and Middle Anglo-Saxon period
(450–750AD). We were eager to see whether there were systematic genetic
differences between these two age groups and between each of them and modern
English individuals.</p>
<p>The first thing we noticed is that all ten individuals are genetically
relatively similar, and that they all looked relatively “English”, similar to
modern English individuals. This was expected, because the indigenous (Celtic)
population in Britain and the immigrating (Germanic) population were very
closely related, with a common ancestor perhaps a few hundred generations back
in time. Most methods to analyse population relationships are based common
mutations, most of which are shared between all populations in the world today,
so it is hard to use them to distinguish two recently diverged populations in
small Europe.</p>
<hr />
<p>We therefore decided to look for rare mutations that are shared by only a few
people out of hundreds of people. The general idea is that if we see a mutation
that is shared among two isolated populations, this mutation must have occurred
at a time when those two populations were still together, so before their
isolation. The longer two populations have been isolated, the fewer shared
mutations between these two populations we should see. This effect is most
pronounced for rare mutations, because rare mutations are relatively younger
than common mutations, so are more informative about recent population
separations.</p>
<p>To find these rare mutations, we analysed the genomes of hundreds of people
living today in Europe and selected mutations that were found in not more than
0.5% of all chromosomes. Because we were interested in finding
“Anglo-Saxon-specific” mutations, we especially looked for genetic variants
found in modern-day Dutch people (who live closest to where the Anglo-Saxons
supposedly came from). We then looked at how many of those rare “Dutch
mutations” were shared by our ancient samples and by modern British people. Here
is a figure showing the results:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/anglo-saxon-ras-model.jpg" />
<figcaption>
This figure shows the relative number of rare mutations that each ancient sample
(coloured dots) shares with modern Dutch individuals. The number has been
normalized by sharing with modern Spanish individuals. Anglo-Saxon immigrants
(red and orange) have more rare “Dutch mutations” than modern English people
(black) and people who lived in England in the Iron Age (in green and blue),
before the Anglo-Saxons came. Figure from our article (License: CC BY 4.0)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the absolute numbers shown below the plot are normalized and without
absolute meaning. Only the relative positioning of the samples matters. First,
we can see that most of the Anglo-Saxon samples (in red and orange) carry about
50% <em>more</em> rare Dutch mutations than the Iron Age samples do (in blue and
green), which is quite a strong signal. Second, we find that modern English
samples carry an intermediate number of rare Dutch mutations, compared to Iron
Age and Anglo-Saxon samples. More precisely, the modern English samples place at
38% on average between the Iron Age and the Anglo-Saxon samples (100% would be
all the way to the right at the Anglo-Saxons, 0% would be all the way left to
the Iron Age samples). And because allele sharing is linear under admixture, we
conclude that modern English can be modelled as a two-way mixture of 38%
Anglo-Saxon ancestry, and 62% Iron Age ancestry.</p>
<p>When I say “most of the Anglo-Saxon samples”, I meant that we had two
exceptions. Two samples, labeled O3 and O4 in the figure above stand out: Sample
O3 places somewhere in between the Anglo-Saxon and Iron Age samples, while
sample O4 falls completely within the range of the Iron Age samples. This
suggested to us that O3 and O4 carry 50% and 100% indigenous ancestry,
respectively.</p>
<p>At this point it is worth pointing out that O1, O2, O3 and O4 are four female
samples excavated in Oakington (East England), on a large Anglo-Saxon cemetery
with remains from over 120 individuals. Archaeologically, that cemetery is
clearly of Anglo-Saxon culture. So the two suspicous women (O3 and O4) were
buried with Anglo-Saxon grave goods and alongside other Anglo-Saxons (O1 and
O2). It was therefore very surprising for us to find that two out of four
individuals that we looked at where of (partial) indigenous British ancestry. It
suggests that at least in this one cemetery, mixing and inter-marriage between
immigrants and Natives occured already at the very first phase of the
Anglo-Saxon period.</p>
<p>There is one important caveat to our way of modelling modern England as a
two-way mixture: We assume that the Iron-Age samples represent “Pre-Anglo-Saxon”
England, although there were about 400 years between the Iron Age and until the
Anglo-Saxons came. And this was the time period where the Roman empire ruled the
country. However, any external genetic contribution from Roman time would only
influence our mixture estimate if it was equally close to the Dutch as the
Anglo-Saxons were. We think that any such contribution was — if at all — small.
A similar argument holds for other later continental contributions from the
Vikings or Normans. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160119/ncomms10326/full/ncomms10326.html">another ancient DNA
study</a>
confirms this view by genetically analysing ancient British soldiers from the
Roman time, and found that there was overall genetic continuity during the Roman
occupation.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think the Anglo-Saxon migration period is a prime example for a relatively
recent event in human history that is now made accessible to genetic studies. In
this post I have summarized some of the main results of our work on that subject
using ancient DNA. In the next post I will cover our new method <em>rarecoal</em>,
which allows us to infer population history more explicitly from rare mutations,
and also to pin down the relationship of the ancient samples with modern
Europeans more quantitatively.</p>
