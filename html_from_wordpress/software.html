All of my software can be found on github. For discussions around MSMC, we have a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/msmc-popgen">google group</a> that you can participate in.

Most of my recent software is written in <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.
<h4><a href="http://www.github.com/stschiff/msmc">MSMC</a></h4>
A method for analysing multiple genome sequences to infer past population sizes and separation history between populations. A utilities framework <a href="http://www.github.com/stschiff/msmc-tools">msmc-tools</a> is available as well. Written in <a href="https://dlang.org">D</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org">python</a>.
<h4><a href="http://www.github.com/stschiff/msmc2">MSMC2</a></h4>
A modified version of MSMC that is still under development. For analysing population size history, MSMC2 is recommended over MSMC. For cross-population analyses I would suggest to wait, since we are still dealing with some issues. A utilities framework <a href="http://www.github.com/stschiff/msmc-tools">msmc-tools</a> is available as well. Written in <a href="https://dlang.org">D</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org">python</a>.
<h4><a href="http://www.github.com/stschiff/rarecoal">Rarecoal</a></h4>
A method to model population graphs from the rare site frequency spectrum in multiple populations with large numbers of samples. A utilities package <a href="https://github.com/stschiff/rarecoal-tools">rarecoal-tools</a> is available as well. Written in <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.
<h4><a href="http://www.github.com/stschiff/tman">Tman</a></h4>
This is a tool for running and monitoring large numbers of jobs on Cluster environments. The tool is still in alpha-phase. Written in <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.
<h4><a href="http://www.github.com/stschiff/sequenceTools">SequenceTools</a></h4>
This package contains two programs "pileupCaller" and "vcf2eigenstrat". PileupCaller is used to sample alleles from an alignment file at a set of positions. VCF2eigenstrat converts a VCF file into eigenstrat format. Written in <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.
<h4><a href="https://github.com/stschiff/mergeAndClipFastq">MergeAndClip</a></h4>
A program to process raw paired-end sequencing data from ancient DNA libraries. Written in <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.
