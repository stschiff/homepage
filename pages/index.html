    I am group leader for population genetics at the Department for Archaeogenetics of the <a href="http://www.shh.mpg.de/en">Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena</a>. My <a href="http://stephanschiffels.de/?page_id=8">group</a> at the MPI investigates human history by means of Genetics, and develops computational methods to model and analyse ancient and modern genomic data.
