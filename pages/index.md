I am group leader for population genetics at the Department for Archaeogenetics of the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](http://www.eva.mpg.de) in Leipzig, Germany. My [research group](https://www.eva.mpg.de/archaeogenetics/research-groups/population-genetics/) at the MPI investigates human history by means of Genetics, and develops computational methods to model and analyse ancient and modern genomic data.
